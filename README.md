Hello everybody,

KillingspreeArduino here.

At this moment I have 2 projects:
First:
I will be creating a flux compassitor with working input and running flux compassitor. This is for a scouting summer camp (after the corrona restrictions). I Will be posting as I go so annybody can follow me.

Second:
A few months ago I got a idee of creating an frankenstine N64, PS2 hybrit console. So I orderd an Arduino to combine the consoles (no idee how to but combining the outputs will be a first version).

The project will go like this:
01 Combining the consols outputs;
02 Creating a shared housing (without destroying the original housing);
03 Making playing on any controller possible (first only N64 and PS1/2 later when a sub step of 04 is compleated also the controller of the cardrige when room is avalable);
04 Creating a cardrige input to read the cardrige of at least:
   a NES;
   b SNES;
   c Gameboy;
   d Gameboy colour;
   e Gameboy advanced;
   f Gameboy Dual Screen (DS);
   g Gameboy 3 dimential Dual Screen (3DS) (without 3D output);
   h Sega Master System 2;
   i Sega Mega Drive;
   j Sega Genisis;
   k Even older consoles if room is avalible;
05 Making saving posible on the cardriges;
06 Playing direct from the cardrige (including saving);
07 Saving to an external SD card;
08 creating a cheat system;

The system will not be able to read roms out of the box. This is becouse of legal reasons. It will houwever be open sourse so I will not be creating it but everyboddy can create it for him or her self.
