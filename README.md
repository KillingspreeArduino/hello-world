Hello everybody,

KillingspreeArduino here.

In school I did a lot with electronics. In my current job (witch I like btw) I don’t do as much with this as I would like so When our group at scouting thought of going on a 75 year anniversary and asked my group to build a Time machine (DeLorean) I thought of building a flux capacitor and ordered an Arduino to be the brain of the build and thinking ahead to build something else with it.

So at this moment I have 2 projects:
First:
I will be creating a flux capacitor with working input and running flux capacitor. This is for a scouting summer camp (after the Corona restrictions). I Will be posting as I go so anybody can follow me.

Second:
A few months ago I got a idea of creating an Frankenstein N64, PS2 hybrid console. So I ordered an Arduino to combine the consoles (no idea how to but combining the outputs will be a first version).

The project will go like this:
01 Combining the console outputs;
02 Creating a shared housing (without destroying the original housing);
03 Making playing on any controller possible (first only N64 and PS1/2 later when a sub step of 04 is completed also the controller of the cartridge when room is available);
04 Creating a cartridge input to read the cartridge of at least:
   a NES;
   b SNES;
   c Gameboy;
   d Gameboy color;
   e Gameboy advanced;
   f Gameboy Dual Screen (DS);
   g Gameboy 3 dimensional Dual Screen (3DS) (without 3D output);
   h Sega Master System 2;
   i Sega Mega Drive;
   j Sega Genesis;
   k Even older consoles if room is available;
05 Making saving possible on the cartridges;
06 Playing direct from the cartridge (including saving);
07 Saving to an external SD card;
08 creating a cheat system;

The system will not be able to read ROMs out of the box. This is because of legal reasons. It will however be open source so I will not be creating it but everybody can create it for him or herself.
